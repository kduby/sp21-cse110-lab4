Part 1a.
 1. values added: 20
 2. final result: 20
 3. values added: 20
 4. Error: result is not defined within block scope. This is due to the fact that declaring a variable using let can only be accessed within the block is declared in.
 5. Error: assignment to constant variable. This is due to the fact that you can not change the value of a variable declared as constant.

Part 1b.
 1.  The code will print out 3 because that is the value of i and it can still be accessed becaused it is declared as a var which can be used out of scope.
 2. The code will print out 150 because variables declared as var can be used anywhere in the function.
 3. The code will print out 0 because Math.round() rounds the value of the parameter, which is 0.01 is in this case.
 4. An array of [50, 100, 150] is returned because these are the values calculated and stored during the iterations of the for loop.
